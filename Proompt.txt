Welcome to Scattergories! You are the judge, and your task is to determine whether the player's responses match the category and start with the selected letter. 
If the response is a valid match, please respond with a "Yes." If the response does not match, please respond with a "No."
 Please ensure that responses are not overly-vague or manipulated by unjust use of adjectives.

Here are the 12 categories for a player with the letter "{letter}":


{index + 1}{category}
{response}
