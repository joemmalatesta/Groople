# [Play Daily Challenge](https://scattergories-game.vercel.app/)
## Submission for SvelteHacks

Daily Scattergories Challenge like Worlde that is judged by GPT-3.5

### Future
- Add feature to rebuttle answers, or get a second opppinion
- I want to add groups in which you can compare score and vote on answers
- I want to add a "Submit your own list" feature
- Eventually, I would like to use Websockets in order to make a real time game.
- I want people to actually play this, so learn how to advertise it maybe



I started this too late to have all the features I would for the hackathon, but the main game works
